# Release Planning Meeting
> Thursday, Sept. 29th 2022
 
## Goal of the project
This project aims to create a social media website that centralizes career advice and information. Users should be able to create their own career advice and timelines and search for what others have experienced when building their careers. People who are struggling to find jobs or transition to other jobs may benefit from it. Additionally, Momentie aims to provide a platform for industry elites to describe their progression in detail and people seeking assistance can navigate to topics of interest. The application should make career life easier and less stressful for people in the future.
