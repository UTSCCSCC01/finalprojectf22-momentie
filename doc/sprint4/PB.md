Around 20 (Need to also add these on JIRA)

Try to relate to a persona. if personas are not done, use a persona of your choice and we will match them Thursday. unless it's really a general use case.



Each user story must obey the format stated in the lecture and it must also contain the criteria of satisfaction. For this stage, there is no need to estimate user stories. 



 - Agree (as a team) on the point scale you will use to evaluate your stories

 - Agree (as a team) how many points you will do in sprint 1 (your velocity)

 - Evaluate (using poker play) top priority stories (just enough to fill in the points for sprint 1)



Priority point: P

High priority: HP

Mid priority: MP

Low priority: LP



Difficulty point: D

0 is the lowest, 89 is the highest

Choice are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89
