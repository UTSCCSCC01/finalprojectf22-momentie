Reflect on how your team worked together.

 - Have a friendly atomosphere 
 - Evenly taking responsibility
 - Finish all work on time

How did you organize the team? Which tools did you use, if any?
 - Discord: public announcement
 - WeChat: efficient/private conversations
 - Git: clearly describe for commits and submit works through Git
 - Organize team meeting and responsibilities with team contracts

How did you make decisions?
 - Hold in-person meetings to discuss amongst team
 - Specialized/minor decisitions (only related to front-end design) can be made in a smaller group
 - The decision should be determined by the majority and will be finalized once the decision is approved

How did you define priority and/or points of user stories? How many rounds of voting (on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?
 - Priority is discussed and determined in team meetings
 - Using Planning Poker to claculate the average point for user stories
 - At least 2 rounds of voting is needed to formulate a concensus, 89 is the hardest, 0 is the simplest.

How frequently did you meet?
 - appoximately 4 times per week, with 3 standmeetings(15min long) and one 2hour long meeting.
 
What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?
 - Start making pre-meeting notes so we do not lose track of topics.
 - Certain topics does not need to be discussed in group, as they can be distributed to specific group/individual(backend specific, frontend specific, etc.).
