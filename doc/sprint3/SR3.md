## Practices that Need to Continue During Next Sprint
 - Trello and Github intergrations

 - Ask questions on time and commit regularly

 - Be on time for meetings

 - Checklist on Trello to help visualize story responsibility

 - Adds dependency / blocker tags using Trello on tasks so we can prioritize the unblocked tasks

## Practices we Should Stop Using

 - Avoid cramming near the end of the sprint.

 - Avoid deleting tasks as it causes Trello disfunction. Use archive instead.

 - Documentatio should be done immediately after the feature is implemented

## Best Experience 

 - Tasks flow in smoothly and time distributed evenly

 - Learn new techniques with team members.

 - Taking this course with 5 courses   

## Unfinished Tasks

 - Beautify Post and Tag component

 - Add About page.

 - Refine error handling on home and profile pages

 - Logout should not use alert anymore

 - Timeline replace failing can cause user to lose all timeline.
