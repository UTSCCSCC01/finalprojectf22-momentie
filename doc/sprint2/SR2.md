## Practices that Need to Continue During Next Sprint
 - Trello and Github intergrations

 - Ask questions on time and commit regularly

 - Be on time for meetings

## Practices we Should Stop Using

 - Avoid cramming near the end of the sprint.

## Best Experience

 - Learn new techniques with team members.
 

## Worst Experience

 - Last minute cramming  

 - Look at some code with no comments  

 - A person without art talent makes page view  

 - Taking this course with 5 courses   

## Unfinished Tasks

 - Status code is not matching standard.

 - Username is missing from profile

 - User login and logout is not as responsive to user action as we wanted it to.

 - Current error handling on pages can cause bad user experience
